# Fashion-Handwriting-Classifier-FHC-
This project involved developing deep learning models to classify fashion items and handwritten digits using TensorFlow and Keras.
- For Fashion MNIST, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained to accurately predict clothing categories from images, achieving over 99% accuracy.
- The project was extended with Handwriting MNIST, allowing manual drawing of digits via a canvas interface, followed by real-time prediction.
- Key elements included **data preprocessing, model optimization using dropout regularization, and deployment in a user-friendly interface for practical applications**.
